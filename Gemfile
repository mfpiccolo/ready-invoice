# Salesforce Related Gems:
gem 'databasedotcom-oauth2' #basic rest access to salesforce.com.
# alternative gem interface: https://github.com/ejholmes/restforce
# Salesforce / Heroku / et. all seem to have largely abandoned
# databasedotcom as a project, with several features lacking or
# functionallity falling behind EJHolmes restforce gem. It should
# be noted that Eric (EJHolmes) was the original author of
# databasedotcom (i'm like 99.5% sure of that.)

gem 'databasedotcom-rails', :git => 'git@github.com:noeticpenguin/databasedotcom-rails.git'
# this gem gives you some auto-wizbang
# voodoo to automatically back your controllers with models in
# salesforce. Using this gem allows you to autowire, for instance
# the Opportunity controller in your rails app, to salesforces'
# Opportunity object. You may be asking why the git-version?
# my fork (this git version) allows you to use an externally
# gathered oauth token rather than re-logging in on every call. neat.

gem 'omniauth-salesforce' # 'cause if you're going to go to the work
# of setting up an integration with salesforce for data, you might
# as well be able to authenticate against salesforce as well right?

#Nice to have gems:
gem 'activeadmin', github: 'gregbell/active_admin'
# Nice, Quick, stupid simple dsl and framework
# for "admin" sections in your rails app. Use this, for instance,
# to dynamically adjust which properties or fields your
# databasedotcom-rails model's pull / push to optimize speed!
